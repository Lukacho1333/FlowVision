FlowVision MVP Requirements Document
1. Overview
1.1 Project Description
FlowVision is a web-based AI-powered efficiency intelligence platform for SMB leadership to detect operational friction, categorize improvement ideas, and create strategic roadmaps to transform organizational flow. It helps identify issues, prioritize via matrices/charts, track progress on Kanban/roadmap views, with AI-powered suggestions for friction detection and categorization.
1.2 Purpose

Enable quick issue identification and initiative alignment.
Provide visual prioritization and tracking.
Scale for internal use, potential commercial SaaS.
MVP: Functional core with best practices for development, testing, and maintenance.

1.3 Scope

MVP: User auth, dashboard, initiative cards, prioritization matrix, Kanban tracking, roadmap view, business profile for AI assumptions, audit logs.
Out-of-Scope: Advanced AI ML models, full integrations (e.g., Jira API—phased), mobile app.
Assumptions: Users have basic web access; SMB size <50 users.
Constraints: No hardcoding (use env vars, seed DB); budget-friendly stack; Cursor-compatible for AI-assisted build.

1.4 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js with Next.js for SSR/SEO scalability.
Backend: Node.js/Express for APIs.
Database: PostgreSQL for relational integrity (scalable with indexes).
AI: Rule-based heuristics + optional OpenAI API for NLP (e.g., suggestions).
Testing: Jest (unit), Cypress (E2E), 80% coverage min.
Other: Git for version control, Docker for containerization, Winston for logging.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Authentication

FR1.1: Register/login with email/password (JWT tokens).
FR1.2: Role-based access (Admin/Leader—seed initial admin).
Acceptance: Secure hashing (bcrypt), session expiry.

2.2 Business Profile Setup

FR2.1: Onboarding wizard for industry, size, metrics (stored in DB).
FR2.2: Editable profile used for AI assumptions.
Acceptance: Form validation, seed sample profiles.

2.3 Issue Identification

FR3.1: Input form with voting/polling for issues.
FR3.2: Visual heatmap of hotspots.
FR3.3: AI option: Suggest issues from uploaded notes (NLP parse).
Acceptance: Real-time updates (WebSockets or polling).

2.4 Initiative Definition and Cards

FR4.1: Create/edit cards with fields: Title, Problem, Goal, KPIs, Owner, Timeline, Status, Progress, Dependencies.
FR4.2: Optional AI: Generate difficulty/cost/ROI badges based on profile + heuristics (e.g., keyword scoring).
Acceptance: Drag-drop for fields, attachments support.

2.5 Prioritization

FR5.1: Matrix/bubble chart view; drag-reorder with voting.
FR5.2: AI boost: Score suggestions (rule-based, editable).
Acceptance: Export to PDF.

2.6 Tracking

FR6.1: Kanban board with columns (Define/Prioritize/In Progress/Done).
FR6.2: Progress bars, notifications.
Acceptance: Dependency mapping.

2.7 Roadmap View

FR7.1: Timeline bars with milestones, dependencies.
FR7.2: Interactive drag/zoom, filters.
FR7.3: Future hook: Epic/story status sync (manual tags in MVP).
Acceptance: Auto-sync from cards.

2.8 Task Logging and Auditing

FR8.1: DB entity for logs (user actions, timestamps, changes).
FR8.2: Viewable audit trail per initiative.
Acceptance: Immutable logs, exportable.

2.9 AI Integration

FR9.1: Toggleable; use for suggestions (e.g., ROI calc: (Gain - Cost)/Cost from inputs).
FR9.2: Benchmarks from seed DB (e.g., industry avgs).
Acceptance: Mock mode for offline/testing.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Performance: <2s load times, handle 100 concurrent users.
NFR2: Scalability: Cloud-ready (e.g., AWS/Heroku), modular code.
NFR3: Security: HTTPS, input sanitization, GDPR-compliant.
NFR4: Usability: WCAG 2.1 AA, responsive (mobile-first).
NFR5: Reliability: 99% uptime, error handling.
NFR6: Maintainability: Clean code (ESLint), docs (JSDoc).

4. User Stories

As a leader, I want to create an initiative card so I can define problems/goals (Priority: High; Acceptance: Fields saved to DB).
As a team, I want to prioritize via matrix so we align on top initiatives (High; Drag-drop persists).
As an admin, I want audit logs so I can track changes (Medium; Queryable).
(Additional stories for each FR.)

5. Data Model

Entities:

User: id, email, password_hash, role.
BusinessProfile: id, user_id, industry, size, metrics (JSON).
Initiative: id, title, problem, goal, kpis (array), owner_id, timeline_start/end, status, progress, dependencies (array of ids).
Issue: id, description, votes, heatmap_score.
AuditLog: id, user_id, action, timestamp, details.


Seeds: Script to insert sample users, profiles, initiatives (e.g., "Sample Growth Initiative" with defaults).
Relationships: One-to-Many (User to Initiatives), Many-to-Many (Initiatives dependencies).

6. IA and UX Flows

Navigation: Sidebar (Dashboard, Initiatives, Prioritize, Track, Roadmap, Profile, Logs).
Flows: Login > Dashboard (overview) > New Initiative (wizard) > Prioritize (matrix) > Track (Kanban) > Roadmap (timeline).
Wireframes: Simple sketches (e.g., card as div with badges, roadmap as horizontal scroll).

7. Design System

Colors: Primary #007BFF, Success #28A745, Warning #FFC107.
Typography: Roboto font, headings 24px/18px.
Components: Reusable Card, Button, Chart (via Recharts).
Consistency: Design tokens in CSS vars.

8. Development Best Practices

Code: Modular (components/services), no hardcoding (use constants from DB/env).
Versioning: Semantic, branches (feature/main).
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for tests/deploy.
Logging: Winston for tasks/errors.

9. QA Measures

Unit Tests: Cover 80% (functions, components via Jest).
Integration Tests: API endpoints (Supertest).
E2E: User flows (Cypress).
Other: Linting (ESLint), Security scans (npm audit), Usability testing (scenarios).

10. Deployment and Scaling

MVP: Local dev, deploy to Vercel/Netlify.
Scale: Add caching (Redis), load balancing.
